<p>Hi, I'm Pedro! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>Based in Berlin, Germany, I'm a Software Engineer at <strong>Ostrom</strong> working on sustainable energy solutions. Originally from Porto, Portugal, I've brought my passion for clean code and renewable energy to the vibrant tech scene of Berlin.</p>

<p>Here, I specialize in backend development, building scalable systems with <strong>TypeScript</strong> and contributing to the future of energy technology. My work focuses on developing energy management platforms and virtual power plant systems that help optimize energy consumption and support renewable energy integration.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying the diverse culture that Berlin has to offer.</p>
