## The Problem: Context Switching Kills Flow

Modern developers often juggle between their code editor and tools like ChatGPT. While powerful, this constant context-switching disrupts focus and slows down development.

## The Core Idea

Cursor flips the script: instead of working alongside an AI tool, it brings AI into the editor itself. An AI-native code editor that acts like a true pair programmer — embedded, context-aware, and always available.

## What Is Cursor?


## Key Features

Cursor is not just an editor. It's a supercharged development environment packed with intelligent features:


These features become even more powerful with light customization from the user — making Cursor adaptable to your style and stack.

## Cursor Rules: Custom Intelligence

Cursor introduces a concept called Cursor Rules, which lets you train the AI on your team's coding preferences.

There are two types:

### Why Use Cursor Rules?


In short: Cursor becomes a custom coding assistant that writes like you and your team.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

One of Cursor's most exciting innovations is MCP, an open protocol that standardizes how applications feed context to large language models (LLMs).

### What does this unlock?

**Without MCP:**

**With MCP:**

## Live Demo: Build a Slack-Style Chat App

Cursor's power becomes real in practice. With a simple prompt like:

```typescript
// Example prompt for Cursor
Build a simple Express backend for a Slack-style chat app. It should have endpoints to:
Also create a simple frontend with inputs for user, channel, and message.
```

You can go from idea to functional prototype in minutes — backend, frontend, and even deployment-ready code.

## Of Course... It's Not All Rainbows and Butterflies

No tool is perfect. Integrating Cursor into your workflow requires change — and like all AI-powered tools, it's only as good as the context it's given.

But for teams that invest in setup and customization, the payoff is massive.

## Conclusion

Cursor isn't just another code editor. It's a bold reimagining of how we write software — turning AI into a collaborative, context-aware teammate.

Whether you're debugging faster, generating docs instantly, or enforcing team standards with Cursor Rules, this tool has the potential to transform the way we code.
