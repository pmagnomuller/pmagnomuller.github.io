In a world where coding productivity tools are evolving rapidly, Cursor is pioneering a new frontier. Founded by four MIT students in 2022, the company launched publicly in 2023 and quickly made waves raising an $8 million seed round led by OpenAI's Startup Fund. Fast forward to February 2025, and Cursor hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), becoming the fastest-growing SaaS company to date.

## The Problem: Context Switching Kills Flow

Modern developers often juggle between their code editor and tools like ChatGPT. While powerful, this constant context-switching disrupts focus and slows down development.

## The Core Idea

Cursor flips the script: instead of working alongside an AI tool, it brings AI into the editor itself. An AI-native code editor that acts like a true pair programmer — embedded, context-aware, and always available.

## What Is Cursor?

- A new workflow for developers
- A new way of thinking about code as structured, contextual text
- A new tool that feels like an extension of your brain, rather than just your keyboard

## Key Features

Cursor is not just an editor. It's a supercharged development environment packed with intelligent features:

- Find and fix bugs fast
- Context-aware autocomplete
- Generate tests and documentation in seconds

These features become even more powerful with light customization from the user — making Cursor adaptable to your style and stack.

## Cursor Rules: Custom Intelligence

Cursor introduces a concept called Cursor Rules, which lets you train the AI on your team's coding preferences.

There are two types:
- **Project Rules**: Shared in a codebase. Enforce team/repo-specific best practices.
- **Global Rules**: Personal. Apply your own coding preferences.

### Why Use Cursor Rules?

- Enforce naming conventions and architectural choices
- Prefer specific libraries, folder structures, or types
- Avoid unwanted patterns (e.g., `console.log`, `any`)
- Tailor AI suggestions to your team's opinionated style

In short: Cursor becomes a custom coding assistant that writes like you and your team.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

One of Cursor's most exciting innovations is MCP, an open protocol that standardizes how applications feed context to large language models (LLMs).

### What does this unlock?

**Without MCP:**
- AI guesses table names
- Uses raw HTML/CSS
- Offers generic SQL
- Sees only open files

**With MCP:**
- AI knows your schema
- Uses design system components
- Provides validated queries
- Sees full project context

## Live Demo: Build a Slack-Style Chat App

Cursor's power becomes real in practice. With a simple prompt like:

```typescript
// Example prompt for Cursor
Build a simple Express backend for a Slack-style chat app. It should have endpoints to:
- Create a user
- Create a channel
- Send a message
- Get all messages in a channel
Also create a simple frontend with inputs for user, channel, and message.
```

You can go from idea to functional prototype in minutes — backend, frontend, and even deployment-ready code.

## Of Course... It's Not All Rainbows and Butterflies

No tool is perfect. Integrating Cursor into your workflow requires change — and like all AI-powered tools, it's only as good as the context it's given.

But for teams that invest in setup and customization, the payoff is massive.

## Conclusion

Cursor isn't just another code editor. It's a bold reimagining of how we write software — turning AI into a collaborative, context-aware teammate.

Whether you're debugging faster, generating docs instantly, or enforcing team standards with Cursor Rules, this tool has the potential to transform the way we code.
